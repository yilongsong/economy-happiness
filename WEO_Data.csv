By the former Central Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Croatia (CroStat), now the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (CBS, www.dzs.hr). Latest actual data: 2021 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods. Formula used to derive volumes: Fisher. Export and import price indices were calculated according to the Fisher s, so-called ideal, formula, which is a geometrical mean between the Laspeyres  and Paasche s formulae. Chain-weighted: No. Export and import price indices are calculated as monthly or quarterly as compared to the base year (previous year). For example, export and import price indices for the first quarter of 2011 are calculated as compared to the period from January to December 2010. Trade System: Special trade. Special - special trade in a wider sense: processing in customs warehouses and free zones are included. Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Re-exports; Re-imports;. This statistics does not include temporary export and import (less than two years) of goods that are returned to the owner in an unaltered state, services, monetary gold, goods used as carriers of customized information including software and software downloaded from the Internet, means of payment which are legal tender and securities, goods supplied free of charge which are not the subject of commercial transactions (advertising material and commercial samples), supplying of Croatian diplomatic missions abroad and foreign diplomatic missions in the Republic of Croatia, and temporary exports and imports for repair. For 2016, transaction imports below 1.8 million kuna and exports below 0.9 million kuna are exempted from statistical reports. Oil coverage: Primary or unrefined products; Secondary or refined products; Other; Valuation of exports: Free on board (FOB). The export values are calculated on the basis of the FOB parity. It means that the invoice value is reduced for transportation and other costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery abroad, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is increased by the costs incurred from the place of delivery in Croatia to the Croatian border. Valuation of imports: Cost, insurance, freight (CIF). The import values are calculated on the basis of the CIF parity. It means that the invoice value is increased by transportation and other costs incurred from the place of delivery abroad to the Croatian border, if it is agreed that goods are delivered abroad. If it is agreed for delivery to take place in the country (Republic of Croatia), the invoice value is reduced for the costs incurred from the Croatian border to the place of delivery in Croatia.

Latest actual data: 2021 Notes: The authorities produce data from 1995 only; Earlier data result from splicing. Base year: 2005 Methodology used to derive volumes: Deflation by unit value indexes (from customs data). Export and import price indices were calculated as unit value indices, in other words, indices of the change of the export and import value per quantity unit of exported/imported goods, that is, per kilogram as a uniform and comparable quantity unit for all goods.

Guinea,"Inflation, average consumer prices",Index,,"Source: National Statistics Office Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: The change in inflation reflects the transition to the new CPI data that the authorities released in November 2022. The new index, starting from August 2022, has updated its weights from 2002 to 2019, and expanded coverage to include the entire country instead of just Conakry as in the previous index. It was developed with technical assistance from AFRISTAT and reviewed by STA. The figures presented in the tables rely only on Conakry s information, as there is insufficient data available for the other regions to calculate an annual average. Further changes will need to be accommodated once there is sufficient data availability to transition to the full-country index. The new CPI results in a lower inflation rate at the end of 2022 and a faster decline in inflation in 2023.

Guinea,"Inflation, end of period consumer prices",Index,,"Source: National Statistics Office Latest actual data: 2022 Notes: The change in inflation reflects the transition to the new CPI data that the authorities released in November 2022. The new index, starting from August 2022, has updated its weights from 2002 to 2019, and expanded coverage to include the entire country instead of just Conakry as in the previous index. It was developed with technical assistance from AFRISTAT and reviewed by STA. The figures presented in the tables rely only on Conakry s information, as there is insufficient data available for the other regions to calculate an annual average. Further changes will need to be accommodated once there is sufficient data availability to transition to the full-country index. The new CPI results in a lower inflation rate at the end of 2022 and a faster decline in inflation in 2023.

Excluded items in trade: In transit; Low valued; Other;. Excluded items include goods valued under $100, transit trade, temporary export/import trade, repair and maintenance of goods, operational leasing, shuttle trade, border trade, some transactions with declaration that are not goods (cash, valuable paper, stamps, monetary gold, etc.). Other exclusions include border and coastal trade. Customs warehouses, free zones, and duty-free shops in T¸rkiye are considered beyond the customs frontier.
